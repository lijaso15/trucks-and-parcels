# trucks-and-parcels
Visualizing various combinations travelling salesman and knapsack problem solutions

https://lijaso15.github.io/trucks-and-parcels/

## Overview
This combines the travelling salesman and knapsack problem solutions by optmizing the value held by each truck and then optmizing the shortest distances to deliver all the parcels held by each truck.

## Features

1. Randomly generated parcels/trucks
2. Customizible attributes for all parcels/trucks
3. Truck loading algorithms including an 8-subconfiguration greedy algorithm, unordered, and random
4. Parcel routing algorithms including naive (brute force) solution, greedy (nearest neighbour), randomized, and unordered
5. 2-Dimensional view of all cities and color indicator for trucks vs parcels
6. Routing visualization and interactive graph
7. Summary statistics to allow for comparisons of algorithms
